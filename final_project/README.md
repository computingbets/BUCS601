# BU Computer Science 601

## Web Application Development

This project utilizes Javascript, jQuery, and SASS as learned technologies in
BU CS 601. This is a blog style project with five HTML and linked SCSS pages.
The homepage has a modern design completed by `margin 0`. The look of the listcle
and its design came from popular click bait sites, so I mimicked its CSS.

The most fun I had was selecting textures and fonts, which is exemplified in the
op-ed page with Bostonian Red Sox font and a gif for a background size. I also created
a simple Javascript game. It was made with jQuery UI, a new techology for me in
this project. I enjoyed developing this game since I have always wanted to learn
more about indegenious trees, and new technologies of course.
