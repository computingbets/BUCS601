        <dt>SSH</dt>
          <dd> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell"> Secure Shell (SSH)</a> is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. The best known example application is for remote login to computer systems by users.
            SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network in a client-server architecture, connecting an SSH client application with an SSH server. Common applications include remote command-line login and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH. The protocol specification distinguishes between two major versions, referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2.</dd>
        <dt>HTTP</dt>
          <dd> <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html"> HTTP </a> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. The first version of HTTP, referred to as HTTP/0.9, was a simple protocol for raw data transfer across the Internet.</dd>
        <dt>Bluetooth </dt>
          <dd> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bluetooth_protocols"> Bluetooth protocol </a> The Bluetooth protocol stack is split in two parts: a "controller stack" containing the timing critical radio interface, and a "host stack" dealing with high level data. The controller stack is generally implemented in a low cost silicon device containing the Bluetooth radio and a microprocessor. The host stack is generally implemented as part of an operating system</dd>
