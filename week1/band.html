          <dt>Images Du Futur (2013)</dt>
            <dd> A calculated work that grabs the listener and almost instantly converts them to psych, thriller rock. Tracks include 2020, Powers of Ten, and Mirror Mirror convey a whole style, aesthetic, and world that influences and gives a thrill. Fear of the Walking Dead used 2020 in on of their episodes, alluding to (if never heard the track) a pleasant horror.</dd>
        <dt>Hold/Still (2016)</dt>
            <dd>After the experimental, abstract, etheral, and tribal collaboration with the band Jerusalem, Hold/Still is the conferred follow up to Images Du Futur. The takeaways from this album are the build-up tracks Instrument and Translate. Translate sounds like Flight of the Bumblebee if the bumblebee was a hallucinatory bug from a different planet and you like it infecting you. Keyboardist Max Henry puts in a surreal splash of sound that compliments effectively.
              Instrument is another slow-build. The track comes together towards the end and reminds this writer of a climax of a Philip K Dick novel or having psychedelic waves crash over so entertainingly.
